  ESP8266 Blink by Simon Peter
  Blink the blue LED on the ESP-01 module
  This example code is in the public domain

  The blue LED on the ESP-01 module is connected to GPIO1
  (which is also the TXD pin; so we cannot use Serial.print() at the same time)

  Note that this sketch uses LED_BUILTIN to find the pin with the internal LED
*/

// button LED test code. 
// when press the botton, LED is off
// when release the botton, LED is on
// why it is the opposite? press the botton means val == LOW? 
// change to GPIO14, it then works correctly. LED off when GND, on when 3V3.

void setup() {
  pinMode( 14, INPUT);               // 0 is the flash botton
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);     // Initialize the LED_BUILTIN pin as an output
  // need to setup the default value for GPIO14. how? 
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  byte val = digitalRead(14); 
  if (val == HIGH) { 
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // Turn the LED on (Note that LOW is the voltage level
    // but actually the LED is on; this is because
    // it is active low on the ESP-01)
  } else {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // Turn the LED off by making the voltage HIGH
  }
}
